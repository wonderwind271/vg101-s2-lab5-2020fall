# vg101-s2-lab5-2020fall
An interpreter written by C to interpret simple matlab code.

- calculate algebra expressions with +-*/^ and brackets.
- variable assignment
- fprintf (only allow at most 2 parameters, i.e. fprintf("%f\n",a) is accepted but fprintf("%f%d\n",a,b)) is invalid.

**Do not copy these code if you also have this assignment. That will definitely violate um-sjtu ji and Umich's Honor code. I'll not be responsible for the violation.**
